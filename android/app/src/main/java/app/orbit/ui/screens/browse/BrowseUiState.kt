/**
 * Browse state contract. Sealed
 * interface; every variant `@Immutable` for Compose skipping.
 *
 * `Ready.contacts` carries the UI-domain [Contact] projection. Queued
 * contacts come first, in [SurfaceQueueUseCase] order; non-queued members (paused /
 * out-of-active-hours / no-template / engine-null) follow, sorted alphabetically by
 * `displayName`. Per-row queue position is carried in [Ready.queuePositions] (absent
 * entry → non-queued row, rendered without a position number). This ordering is
 * independent of the `dueIds`/`rowStatus` orientation — they still apply per row.
 *
 * `searchQuery` is echoed back so
 * the TextField rendering doesn't need a second `collectAsState()` on the VM's
 * `searchQuery` Flow — one subscription per screen keeps the configuration-change
 * story simple.
 *
 * `activeFilters` reflects the toggled chip set (per BROWSE-02 chip-composition
 * rule: chip×chip = UNION, search×chip = AND).
 *
 * `callLogPermissionDenied` is a banner toggle inside Ready — when true, the
 * screen renders a quiet notice and rows skip the call-time meta line (the
 * "Never called" claim would be dishonest without READ_CALL_LOG). Wired to the
 * real permission check via [BrowseViewModel.onCallLogPermissionChanged].
 *
 * `dueIds` / `rowStatus` carry per-row orientation keyed by
 * the UI contact id ("c-<entityId>"):
 *   - `dueIds` — rows whose membership `nextDueAt` is null or past now AND
 *     that aren't paused/ignored; BrowseRow renders the quiet accent due dot
 *     (features/browse/README.md:23,34).
 *   - `rowStatus` — paused/ignored rows get a muted treatment + status word.
 * Both live on Ready (not only on [Contact]) because [Contact.equals] compares
 * `id` alone — flags riding the Contact copy would not survive StateFlow
 * deduplication.
 *
 * `Empty` = list has zero members.
 * `FilteredEmpty` = the list has members but the active filter chips exclude
 * everyone; the screen renders "No one matches these filters." + a
 * clear-filters action (Empty's "No one here yet." was false
 * for a fully-filtered non-empty list).
 * `NoMatches(query)` = the search query returned zero matches against the
 * filtered set; the screen renders `Nothing matches "{query}".`.
 * `CallLogDenied` = hard gate: READ_CALL_LOG is denied AND a call-history
 * filter chip is active — the chips cannot be answered honestly without the
 * call log, so the screen explains instead of showing a false result set.
